A little game where you play as a rat in space and have to catch coins while avoiding meat cleavers.
This is one of the first things I ever programmed and the code is horrifyingly, beautifully uncomplicated.
I didn't know about abstractions or design patterns - everything is mostly in a single file in a giant function that handles everything. 

When I see the code now, I can think of many ways to make it more "clean", but it is already perfect. It works and is simple.
I wish I could free myself from the shackles of "good" programming and make simple stuff again.
Obviously abstractions and design patterns have their place and are very useful - but I will think very hard about the worth of the complexity they bring in the future.

You can get the game on my [github](https://github.com/ddcveng/citim_potkana). You will need `python3` installed to run it.
