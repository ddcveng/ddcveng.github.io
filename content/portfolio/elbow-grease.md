This is a little puzzle platformer "game" I made in a week for the [Odin game jam](https://itch.io/jam/odin-7-day-jam). 
I did it with the intention of learning the Odin programming language, which rocks by the way.
There is not much game in it, but I am pretty proud of the techical side.
i figured out a [crazy workflow](/posts/blender-as-game-editor) for using blender as the game world editor, which was a lot of fun.

The game revolves around the mechanic of picking up the right items and taking them to the "checkout" area (which is just a brown rectangle right now..).
There is a number of secret areas around the level, which require thinking to access - notice you can stand on the items you place!
The physics are kinda janky, however, and its not possible to access the secret areas all the time - sometimes you clip through the floor :/ - so I made it so you can win even without doing any of the puzzles.

Anyway, if that sounds interesting at all, you can find the game on [Itch](https://ddcveng.itch.io/elbow-grease) and the source code on [GitHub](https://github.com/ddcveng/ElbowGrease).
