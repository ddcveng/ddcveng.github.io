This is a little gamejam game made in a weekend with a friend of mine.
We made it in the Godot game engine and used generative AI for the "art".

Gameplay-wise it is a simple matching game, but I am really happy with how the horror atmosphere turned out.
Making the magnifying lens shader was a lot of fun, as was playing with scary post processing effects.
Its not very accessible to people with bad vision, but I see it more as a surreal work of art than a serious game.
